# J0sueTM's Studio

J0sueTM's studio is a simple audio processing software made from scratch.

## How to use

Make sure to have the vendors (`submodules`) cloned and compiled.

### X11

```bash
cd vendor/x11

# make sure to have the dependencies installed
./autogen.sh

make
```

## Building

For now, just running make is enough.

```bash
make && ./jstudio
```
